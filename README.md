# Computer_Store
This is a Java class project named Computer store that provides a basic implementation of a computer object. The class has four instance variables - brand, model, SN, and price - and provides several methods to get and set these values. The Computer class has two constructors: a default constructor that initializes the instance variables with some default values, and a parameterized constructor that takes four arguments and initializes the instance variables with the passed values. The class also has getter and setter methods for each instance variable, a static method to get the total number of created Computer objects, and an overridden toString() method to return a string representation of the object. Additionally, the class has an equals() method that takes two Computer objects and compares their brand, model, and price values for equality.
