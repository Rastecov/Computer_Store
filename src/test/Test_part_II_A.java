/**
 * This is a Java class named Computer that has four instance variables brand, 
 * model, SN, and price. 
 * The class has two constructors: a default constructor that initializes the instance variables 
 * with some default values, and a parameterized constructor that takes four arguments and 
 * initializes the instance variables with the passed values. 
 * The class also has getter and setter methods for each instance variable,
 *  a static method to get the total number of created Computer objects, and an overridden 
 *  toString() method to return a string representation of the object. 
 *  Additionally, the class has an equals() method that takes two Computer objects 
 *  and compares their brand, model, and price values for equality.
